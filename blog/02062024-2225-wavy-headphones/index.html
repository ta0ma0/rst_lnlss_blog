</div><p>In this neon-drenched hellhole of a town, there ain't a single chips and micro-electronics store to be found. All I need is a simple 3.5 jack connector for my headphones, but I'm stuck soldering this piece of junk together with scrap metal and duct tape. Four hours of my life, gone. I might have to jack into the capital's grid and see what I can scrounge up, but that's a problem for another day. Got a few backup plans up my sleeve.</p>
<p>Linked up with some runners in the chat, setting up a Jitsi for a virtual meet. Ran into some dependency issues, but I'm a quick thinker. Found a workaround and got it installed. I'm wired in now.</p>
<p>Jacked into a co-op game for a couple of hours. We tore through the forest, leaving a trail of pixelated animal carcasses in our wake. Racked up the points until the spawn rate couldn't keep up. Saved our progress and jacked out.</p>
<p>Today's truth: In this fast-paced, neon-lit world, planning years ahead is a fool's game. Life's got a way of jamming your circuits and frying your plans. Best to strap on your headphones, crank up the tunes, and ride the wave wherever it takes you.</p>
