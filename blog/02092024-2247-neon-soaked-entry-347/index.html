</div><p>'Sup, netrunners. Last week, my neural interface went haywire. My synthliver started churning out ethanol like a rogue nanobrewery, flooding my synapses with liquid courage. The levels weren't fatal, but they flatlined at a constant buzz.</p>
<p>I kept grinding out gigs, but my processing speed took a major hit. One day, my wetware glitched hard. Lost all motor control and face-planted, corrupting my cyberarm in the process. Trauma Team swooped in, ran their scripts, and patched up my hardware.</p>
<p>But here's the kicker - I lost two cycles in my corpo-cube. The suits initiated termination protocols - no empathy in the corporate matrix. After a full revolution, I beamed them the Trauma Team's data packet. They halted the pink slip cascade but cut me off from prime gigs. It's a glitch, but that's life in the sprawl.</p>
<p>Thought of cycle: When everything's running smooth, you feel invincible. When the system crashes, fear tries to take root. Stay frosty, stay focused. That's how you survive in this chrome jungle.</p>
