</div><p>Neon mornings with earbuds on, jacking into my favorite brunch spot. I grab a quick hit of oxytocin from my runners and a shot of spirits to wake up the grown-up in me. I may not have an experienced medical chemist on call, but I try to maintain the balance of my neurotransmitters by any means available. Friendly communication is fine, but sometimes it's a burden, both for me and others. That's just how people function in this world.</p>
<p>I decide to grab breakfast at the most likely cafe, run by double emigrants who've made a full cycle of resettlement, fleeing from the eternal war of dictators. The food is delicious, and the owner throws in a small gift of ice cream. Good stuff.
My approach to life is controlled chaos. I calculate the probability and call my driver, requesting a route to one of the ancient churches. Gotcha. We drive along the road to our destination, passing ancient rocks and ruins. I take a moment to drink cold, natural water from what's probably a sacred source, going off-grid to think without thinking. Finally, we return safely.</p>
<p>A quick check of my deck's RAM shows everything is in order. I browse the runners' forum for project examples that might lead to my next gig.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: We can't calculate everything. Sometimes, we have to make decisions using heuristic algorithms.</p>
