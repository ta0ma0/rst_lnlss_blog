</div><p>Neon Morning, Friends and My Best Friend I.
The vacation ended, and I once again plunged into the abyss of social interactions to earn those few credits that keep me from being thrown out onto the neon streets of this anthill, joining the junk beggars and petty thieves. The first days showed that my vacation was very productive. I've adjusted my patterns, calibrated my reactions, and now I feel much better in the storm of emotions swirling around me, simply because I have my own boundaries and point of view. Good.
The only project I worked on during my vacation was a prototype of a fortune-telling machine. From hundreds of gigabytes of books in different languages, it can generate a pseudo-random quote, which will be the result of the fortune-telling - a seed that might push my brain off the ground, or maybe not. In any case, it won't make things worse.</p>
<p>Here's my fortune for today:<br>
