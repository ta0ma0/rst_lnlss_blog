</div><p>Half a cycle back I dropped out of a suborbital, four hundred clicks from a minor settlement that still wears the skin of old cities—mostly the worst parts. Sluggish bandwidth. No shops. No roads. Piles of junk stacked higher than hope. Poverty coded into the bricks. But at least no swarm-traffic, no corporate ant-hill grind. That’s… something.</p>
<p>Hung around, patched into a local corp outpost. Gotta pay for my synthetic coffee, keep the pod’s lights flickering. Like some washed-up Zero drifting home, I share a crash with my mother. Once I thought I’d hack the hive, ride out as a cyber-cowboy, score the big credline. Now? My path diverged long ago. I’ve got a philosophy patch running on my implant, but it glitches. Side effect: only synthetic ethanol calms it. Fix incoming, but not yet.</p>
<p>What I carried out of the Hive—they can’t even parse here. My sheets on the old deck auto-fill themselves, algorithms humming like ghost-hands. Try explaining it? No point. Folks here worship dead trees and ape tricks. That’s the fate of the provinces—running legacy code while the mainframe moves on.</p>
<p>Most of the signals are lost. Evenings drag, grey static stretched thin. Just waiting for the next round of labor for the corp so I don’t flatline before month’s end. Is there a point? None coded. Maybe something spawns down this path, maybe not. I’m not searching yet. Need time to recalibrate, think it through: am I even living in the same world I was born into? Or did the world fork, and I slipped into a parallel build?</p>
<p>Cycle’s Thought Upload: People almost always run the same script. You can’t rewrite them into what you need. At best you point to the horizon—but don’t expect uptake. The new isn’t wanted. The old runs fine.</p>
