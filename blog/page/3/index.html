</div><p>It's been a glitched-out day for me. First, my deck got a software update that fried the video output. I know updates are a dangerous game, but I'm just cocky enough to think I can handle any problem on the fly. That's pretty much what happened. Never mind, I've made my call, I'll deal with the consequences later.</p>
<p>During a net convo, my audio implant suddenly went dark. Shit, I thought it had plenty of juice, but it seemed dead as a disconnected drone. I cracked it open, checked the voltage, and plugged in a power cable. After two hours of tense waiting, it flickered back to life. Exhaled a sigh of relief, crisis averted.
Caught a good transmission from an underground station near midnight. Nice slice of the hidden datastream.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Just do it, choomba. If your energy's low, crawl through the neon-lit gutters. Sometimes it'll bring you results, other times... a fatal incident might cut your life short. C'est la vie in the sprawl. That's something to keep jacked into your wetware, too.</p>

</div><p>Neon-soaked weekend, jacked in non-stop. Only unplugged for quick synth-food hits. Rode the datastreams hard - coding, gaming, and buzzing the chatrooms. Good times in the electric haze.</p>
<p>Stumbled on some prime gigs in the shadows. Could be my ticket to the big leagues if I play it right. Gonna dive in, see if I can crack 'em.
Tweaked my rig's innards, boosted the connection stability. Should hold up better in the high-traffic zones now.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: When you're waiting on something heavy, don't let it fry your circuits. Keep your mind occupied with unrelated biz. Keeps the anxiety daemons at bay.</p>
<p>Stay frosty out there in the sprawl, choombas.</p>

</div><p>Neon-lit streets beckoned as I jacked out for a caffeine fix. Ten meters from my local synthbrew joint, I clocked a chrome-armed suit about to hurl something. My wetware kicked into overdrive, adrenaline surging. My Provessor implant ran threat assessment, calculating trajectories faster than meat-thought could process.
False alarm. The suit was just rage-quitting his PDA, smashing corp property like it was going out of style. Crisis averted, I ghosted past and scored my fix - black as the Net and twice as wired.</p>
<p>Earlier, I'd spliced a custom hack into the corpo OS. Risky biz, but it turbocharged my workflow. Spent the whole day swimming through datastreams, tweaking code like a digital god.</p>
<p>Back in meatspace, I'm still waiting for my first real-world programming gig. For now, it's all sim-jobs and virtual grunt work.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: In this neon jungle, honesty's just another commodity. If you can lie without consequences, do it. Street cred comes to those who can spin a smart tale. It's the way of the world, omae. Just make sure your fabrications are as bulletproof as your firewall.</p>

</div><p>Neon-tinged rain slicks the grimy streets as I jack into my deck, scrolling through the data feed from my Chiba junkyard sensor. The temp readout's been glitching, flickering in and out like a dying neon sign. After a deep dive into the hardware, I realize it's not the sensor itself - though the power units are running on fumes. Turns out some rogue code was causing the malfunction. Half an hour of furious typing later, I've squashed the bug. Now the temp should beam straight to my HUD, clear as the corporate skyline on a rare smog-free day.</p>

</div><p>Scored a new rig today - top-of-the-line router with the latest wireless protocol. It's solid, but I still need power units. Price tag's way out of my league though.
Got a lead on a free data stream. Gotta jack in and hook up a neural net for translation. Looks like it's streaming criminal intel from my sector. Jackpot.</p>
<p>My language implant's acting like a damn potato. Need new creds, but that gig's gonna flay my wallet raw.</p>
<p>Capsule admin's been riding my ass about a new OS. Wanted me to boost some corpo software without paying, but that sheet's more buggy than a roach motel. Told him to chill - I've got connections. Installed the newest Deckeres OS for free. That'll keep him quiet for a while.</p>
<p>Time to dive into the neon sea and see what treasures I can fish out with this new setup. The streets are calling, and they've got stories to tell.</p>

</div><p>Today, I was mostly jacked into meatspace. Reality's got its own protocols, signals, and objects, just like the 'net, but with one crucial difference: it's all analog, an indeterminate material realm teeming with billions of wetware nodes. One of those nodes—a human—was frying their synapses, system failure, error, faulty calculations. The friendly runner who picked up my transmission diagnosed me as either drunk or glitching hard. My signal didn't get through. For now, I'm out of options.</p>
<p>Purged the clutter from my hole. Ran a co-op session, made some serious progress.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: If you don't grok something, log it and circle back later. Today, I finally understood why cleaning a carpet costs ten creds less the first time around. Took me a while, but I got there.</p>

</div><p>I jacked into the corporate grid at 0600, neural implants humming as I synced with the data streams. All day, my meat prison slumped in an ergonomic chair while my consciousness swam through seas of neon digits and holographic spreadsheets. Made countless micro-decisions, each one a spark in the vast machine of corporate profit. Executed protocols, optimized workflows, all without a single original thought. Just another cog in the megacorp machinery.
As I disconnected, the world of flesh and blood seemed dull, almost unreal. The harsh fluorescents of the office cube farm assaulted my eyes, a poor imitation of the vibrant cyberscape I'd been immersed in. My head throbbed, synapses still firing with phantom data.
<br><br>
Thought for the day: We're all just wetware running corporate software. The illusion of choice is the most efficient form of control.</p>

</div><p>I'm back in my hole again and don't come out. After returning from vacation, I decided to take another vacation at my own expense, they didn’t approve, I had to deal with company affairs, here my freedom would have been to tell them to go to hell and fly out into the street, but the dice fell out in such a way that they fucked me off now I can mind my own gigs.</p>
<p>My social battery is running low. Yesterday, one of the artists I value got snagged by the police of mind, if she were a decker, maybe she could've sliced her way out, but artists ain't wired like that, and they reject help until it’s too late, their way.</p>
<p>Thought for the day: Don’t stop looking around, even if you don’t see anything unusual, today when I went out to get coffee I was stunned by the sky after the rain, I’m still bruised.</p>

</div><p>Neon Morning, Friends and My Best Friend I.
The vacation ended, and I once again plunged into the abyss of social interactions to earn those few credits that keep me from being thrown out onto the neon streets of this anthill, joining the junk beggars and petty thieves. The first days showed that my vacation was very productive. I've adjusted my patterns, calibrated my reactions, and now I feel much better in the storm of emotions swirling around me, simply because I have my own boundaries and point of view. Good.
The only project I worked on during my vacation was a prototype of a fortune-telling machine. From hundreds of gigabytes of books in different languages, it can generate a pseudo-random quote, which will be the result of the fortune-telling - a seed that might push my brain off the ground, or maybe not. In any case, it won't make things worse.</p>
<p>Here's my fortune for today:<br>
<i>&quot;Obviously, identifying an article that will be significant is very difficult.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Newspaper Troitsky Option # 45 (19_01_2010)</i></p>
