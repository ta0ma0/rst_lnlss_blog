<p>Hey yo, I say to cyberspace and to myself. I decided to get out of my hole and walk the streets.   The goal is to find a place under the shimmering sky where you can connect to the matrix and immerse yourself in the code. As the old hacker taught me - be prepared for anything, especially the worst.</p>
<p>After packing my electronic arsenal into my bag, I downloaded a holographic map of the city onto my smartphone. The ghost bus, invisible to the system, was perfect for my quest. I jumped inside, plunging into the unknown.</p>
<p>Retro headphones connected by wires to the head are my homage to the old school and a way to save energy in this cutthroat cyberpunk world.</p>
<p>As soon as I had time to take a sip of my favorite sugar-free flat white, my smartphone vibrated, transmitting a message from the virtual world. A friend asks to connect a neural network to design a festival site in augmented reality. He promised to help, but the carefree mood evaporated like smoke from a cigarette. Phantom creds loomed on the horizon again.</p>
<p>Twice I walked past the open terraces of summer cafes, where for a cup of coffee you can buy a ticket to the eternity of cyberspace. Mission Complete. I moved to the air taxi call point, looking into an inconspicuous basement theater along the way. The poster promised a performance based on the biography of the legendary Arab anarchist philosopher Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri. Alas, in an unfamiliar dialect, but I made it clear to the artistic director that I was following events and was ready to immerse myself in art.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day, rekt.network brought out live Vosto, perfectly fitting into the mosaic of my cyberpunk existence.</p>

So, here's the log entry. Armenia, post-mobilization reality. The meat attacks didn't break me, I'm still in the game. Semi-legal cash flow from a remote location, a trusty laptop with access to the office network and the ability to get electronics - these are my arsenal.<br>
<br>
Thoughts, dark and light, swarm in my head. I don’t suppress them, let consciousness grow freely. One of these thoughts is scam. Thousands of fake online stores, money for non-existent goods. But a moral compass does not allow you to go astray.<br>
<br>
The light side took over. I created several websites for local shopkeepers, put on a formal biker jacket, and went to convince. But the Armenian infosphere is a separate universe, under the wing of Meta. Backup options? Did not hear. Thousands of years of history are probably to blame.<br>
<br>
Today: the coffee machine at the supermarket malfunctioned just as I was rushing to a Lethal Company co-op session with two guys from the net. The money was returned, but the coffee had to be taken in backup.
The gaming session is fire. The work phone was silent, two hours of pure fun with the guys.<br>
<br>
The dual boot laptop is buggy. Three freezes in Windows, once dead. I suspect the memory bar, but haven't gotten around to checking it yet.
rekt.network continues to provide excellent soundtracks. A couple more energy drinks and I'm back in business. The contours of a new project loom on the horizon.</p>

</div><p>Slag it all! Life's gone sideways again. Recently, my meat-sack got canned by some corpo scum. Fascist bastards. Forced to relocate to my own sector of the megacity, where even breathing feels like a death wish.
Missed my flight 'cause the first plane was late. Frag it all. Had to score a new ticket for another bird, but my synapses were fried. Ended up booking a seat a whole month out. Corpo suits refunded the first ticket, small mercy.
Now I'm jacked into sector North 59.931130.3609. Interviews ain't for a while, so I'm prepping before I hit the Sprawl. Ran out of meds and caught a nasty glitch. Two sleepless nights had me tearing through Night City like a malfunctioning drone. Finally scored my fix, crawled into my pod, and crashed for a full rotation.
Maybe it patched me up, saved my ass even. Could've taken some damage though. Gonna need a full system scan, but that's for later. Right now, I need creds and a job hunt that won't fry my circuits.
Not all's lost in this neon hell. Seems like the universe is throwing me a bone. Keep your optics crossed for me.</p>
<p>Thought of the cycle: Stay frosty and RUN.</p>
