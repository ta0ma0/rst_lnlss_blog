Neon-soaked weekend, jacked in non-stop. Only unplugged for quick synth-food hits. Rode the datastreams hard - coding, gaming, and buzzing the chatrooms. Good times in the electric haze.

Stumbled on some prime gigs in the shadows. Could be my ticket to the big leagues if I play it right. Gonna dive in, see if I can crack 'em.
Tweaked my rig's innards, boosted the connection stability. Should hold up better in the high-traffic zones now.

Thought of the day: When you're waiting on something heavy, don't let it fry your circuits. Keep your mind occupied with unrelated biz. Keeps the anxiety daemons at bay.

Stay frosty out there in the sprawl, choombas.
