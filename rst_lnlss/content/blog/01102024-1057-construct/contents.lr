The test looms on the horizon, a digital gauntlet I gotta run. Jacked into the matrix, I scored a meet with Case's construct from Neuromancer. The legendary cowboy's still got it - dropped some primo intel on cracking corpo ICE. Respect to the old guard.

These emigrant types crowding my meatspace? Null value. Reached out for a assist, nothing free, and two of 'em shut me down cold. No vision, no solidarity. Just chrome-plated egos and corp-think. Fuckin' high-riders.

Thought of the cycle: When the world gives you static, rely on your own wetware. Save your cred and cycles. But sometimes you need an ally to run the shadows. Cultivate your connections - they're worth more than gold in this neon jungle.
