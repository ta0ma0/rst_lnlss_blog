It's been a glitched-out day for me. First, my deck got a software update that fried the video output. I know updates are a dangerous game, but I'm just cocky enough to think I can handle any problem on the fly. That's pretty much what happened. Never mind, I've made my call, I'll deal with the consequences later.

During a net convo, my audio implant suddenly went dark. Shit, I thought it had plenty of juice, but it seemed dead as a disconnected drone. I cracked it open, checked the voltage, and plugged in a power cable. After two hours of tense waiting, it flickered back to life. Exhaled a sigh of relief, crisis averted.
Caught a good transmission from an underground station near midnight. Nice slice of the hidden datastream.

Thought of the day: Just do it, choomba. If your energy's low, crawl through the neon-lit gutters. Sometimes it'll bring you results, other times... a fatal incident might cut your life short. C'est la vie in the sprawl. That's something to keep jacked into your wetware, too.
