I'm jacked into my rig, immersed in the neon-soaked beats of the music world. No need to venture out into the gritty streets. A few small gigs keep me from flatlinning, but I need more, always scanning for contracts. The job market's a fraggin' mess, too many desperate souls and not enough work to go around. Freelancing? Gotta update my profile and keep a closer eye on the net, but I ain't got the drive for that yet. My mind's always buzzing, searchin' for the next big score, a project to call my own.

Today's my birthday, but ain't no reason to celebrate. Might link up with some fellow runners for a quick meet. Scored a sushi set called Akira, named after that legendary anime. Heh, the irony.

A runner once told me: Don't leave the room, don't make a mistake.
