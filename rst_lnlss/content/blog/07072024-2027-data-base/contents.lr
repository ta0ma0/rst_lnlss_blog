I jacked into a restricted sector of my personal databanks two cycles back. Red flags everywhere, warning labels screaming "potentially unstable," and a flashing neon sign urging me to drown my sorrows in synthetic ethanol. Like a good citizen of this neon-drenched hellscape, I complied. For 48 hours, the bootleg neurochem cocktail did its work, my meat sack sprawled in a coffin-sized sleep pod while an endless stream of algorithmically generated tunes kept my synapses firing.

When I finally clawed my way back to consciousness, I felt factory-fresh. No surprise that my comm stayed silent â€“ isolation's the new normal in this chrome and concrete jungle. To verify I hadn't slipped into some digital purgatory, I pinged the old lady's neural link. Still kicking, still grinding away in meatspace. Confirmation received: I'm still trapped in this reality. All according to the script.

Thought for the Day: There comes a point when finding a glimmer of hope in the real world means carving yourself open with the jagged, rust-coated blade of dystopian truth. The price of awareness is paid in blood and scars.
