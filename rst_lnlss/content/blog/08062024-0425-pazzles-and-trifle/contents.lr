In the neon-drenched morning, I ventured to the post office to retrieve a package containing my single board computer. The city's pulse thrummed through the streets, a symphony of data streams and electric dreams.

Upon powering up the rig, it failed to materialize in my net. A challenge, indeed, but one I relished. After all, it's why I sought them out—to sink my teeth into the problems they presented. I ran through the usual diagnostics: checking the path cord, resetting the router. No dice. Time to start from scratch.
I slotted in a fresh SD, rolled out a new OS, tweaked the settings. Viola! The rig hummed to life, its circuits singing in perfect harmony. A twinge of disappointment flickered through me; with the issue resolved, I found myself without a puzzle to unravel.

My mind's eye wandered over my hardware array, assessing its capabilities, yearning for a project to sink into. But what I lacked was a clear-cut task, a problem with a specific endgame and, of course, a surefire payoff. Without that, my brain refused to engage. It's a tale as old as Edison himself—one invention every seven years. My case was far from unique in this neon-soaked world.
A thought flickered through my mind, a glimmer of insight amidst the city's digital haze: If you leave your change behind in one coffee machine, let your worries drift away on the data streams. In fifteen minutes, you'll find it waiting for you in another, a small treasure in this labyrinthine metropolis.
