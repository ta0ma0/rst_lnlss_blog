The streets of Neo-Tokyo pulsed with neon as I jacked out, my newly upgraded hand implant humming with fresh chrome. The corp suits at the insurance outfit finally coughed up the creds, and I wasted no time maxing out my deck's memory. Now I can run AI directly on my rig, no need for sketchy cloud connections.

My collection of AI constructs is growing, a digital menagerie of code and potential. I've culled the weak ones, leaving only the prime specimens. For now, I'm content to observe, studying their behaviors from every angle, plotting how to leverage their power.

These text-based algos are a far cry from my usual hardware hacks, but a smart runner always diversifies their toolkit. I may not be some hotshot wordsmith, but I'll find a way to bend these digital minds to my will.

Thought of the cycle: Reality can trap you in loops tighter than any black ICE, with no clear exit protocol. Always keep a backup plan in your back pocket â€“ better yet, have two. In this unforgiving sprawl, redundancy isn't just smart, it's survival.
