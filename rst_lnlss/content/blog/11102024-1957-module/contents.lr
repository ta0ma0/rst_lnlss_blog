The input module on my deck flatlined without warning. In a heartbeat, I jacked into the net and ordered a replacement. Five cycles later, the shiny new hardware was sitting on my cluttered workstation. Cracking open the deck's casing to swap it out wasn't high on my to-do list. I almost left it, but after fumbling through another data dive with a glitchy interface, I realized how chrome a solid keyboard really is. One morning, after wrestling with a simple query for two hours, I bit the bullet and performed the surgery.

That black market neurotransmitter patch the street doc hooked me up with is pure platinum. My serotonin readout's been steady in the yellow-green, a welcome change from the constant red alerts I used to get.

My reality isn't defined by the drone of the city's hive. For 12 hours a day, I'm plugged into a non-stop audio feed, only disconnecting to barter with the noodle pushers and synth-meat hawkers on the street.

A runner tipped me off about an underground screening of the ancient classic "Blade Runner" at a hidden speakeasy. Naturally, I slipped in. As always, that flick leaves me in awe.

Thought of the cycle: Keep your bio-monitors in check. Don't let those metrics bleed into the red. Regular maintenance is key â€“ for your gear and yourself.
