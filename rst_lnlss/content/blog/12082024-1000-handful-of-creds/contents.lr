Jacked in again, surfing the datastreams. Been diving deep lately, clocking tens of hours in medieval sims and whole fictional universes teeming with digital life. Crossed paths with a few fellow runners, all of us seeking something in this neon-lit escape. Maybe it's shelter from the gritty meatspace, or just chasing that next-level rush of connection. The tech delivers it all, for a handful of creds.

Thought of the cycle: It's a worn-out line, but sometimes you gotta crash hard into the bedrock before you can kick off and rocket back to the surface. Rock bottom's just a launchpad if you've got the nerve to use it.
