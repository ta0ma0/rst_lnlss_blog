Jacked into the grid, I'm still grinding away for that decrepit megacorp. No upward mobility, cred's barely trickling in, and my co-workers are straight-up corpo drones. But I ain't throwing in the towel yet. Always scanning the datastreams for fresh gigs while I streamline my current grind for kicks and downtime.

Cobbled together a rudimentary AI bot to handle the mind-numbing weekly tasks. It's not perfect, but it's chewing through the most braindead stuff. Solid start.

My biometrics are holding steady, and my serotonin's spiking for some reason. Gotta dive deeper into my neural logs and run some self-diagnostics to figure out why.

Thought of the cycle: Sometimes reality throws you a bone when you least expect it. You don't always know the source of the high, but you ride that wave and keep pushing forward to the next cycle.
