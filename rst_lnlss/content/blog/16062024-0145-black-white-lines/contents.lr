Neon-lit night, two cycles left before the end of my neuro-break. A tinge of melancholy seeps through my circuits. In this dystopian megacity, we toil endlessly for sustenance and shelter. You can take off your pants and don't owe anyone, but this won’t last long.

Meatspace adventures: riding the giga-wheel, exchanging data with a fellow street-runner, and acquiring neural-link audio enhancers. The enhancers are black-market clones, thrice as cheap as the corp-sanctioned originals.

Co-op mission: progress achieved, synergy established.

A full cycle immersed in the Matrix, assimilating fresh intel and subroutines. Rapid neural adaptation, objectives accomplished.

Data-stream of the cycle: In the sprawling urban labyrinth, cycles oscillate between the tolerable and the insufferable. A cliché, but an undeniable truth etched into the very fabric of our existence.
