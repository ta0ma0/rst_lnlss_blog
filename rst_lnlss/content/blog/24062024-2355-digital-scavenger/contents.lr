Scored a new rig today - top-of-the-line router with the latest wireless protocol. It's solid, but I still need power units. Price tag's way out of my league though.
Got a lead on a free data stream. Gotta jack in and hook up a neural net for translation. Looks like it's streaming criminal intel from my sector. Jackpot.

My language implant's acting like a damn potato. Need new creds, but that gig's gonna flay my wallet raw.

Capsule admin's been riding my ass about a new OS. Wanted me to boost some corpo software without paying, but that sheet's more buggy than a roach motel. Told him to chill - I've got connections. Installed the newest Deckeres OS for free. That'll keep him quiet for a while.

Time to dive into the neon sea and see what treasures I can fish out with this new setup. The streets are calling, and they've got stories to tell.
