Serotonin levels flatlined. Jacked out from the corpo grind, crashed hard for 72 hours straight. World turned grayscale, interest levels zeroed out. Complete disconnect.
Need to score a mental chem subscription to boost productivity, but creds are tight. Classic catch-22 in this chrome jungle.

Uncovered some nasty family skeletons while riding the low. Disappointment morphed into cold indifference. Paradoxically, it's a plus. No one to miss in this neon wasteland. The worse it gets, the better off I am.

Insomnia hit like a freight train. Navigating life with factory settings is a glitch-fest, but can't afford neural patches. Yet.

Started emerging from my coffin-sized pod more often. The crush of bodies and the buzz of the streets, even without direct interface, acted like a crude patch. Scored some melatonin to regulate my sleep cycle. Seems to be taking the edge off.

Thought of cycle: Sometimes the human neural net throws you a lifeline. A stranger shared their experience database, matching my situation beat for beat. Raw data makes the grind bearable. In this cutthroat datasphere, freely given intel is practically a glitch in the Matrix.
