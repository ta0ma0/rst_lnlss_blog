Neon-tinged rain slicks the grimy streets as I jack into my deck, scrolling through the data feed from my Chiba junkyard sensor. The temp readout's been glitching, flickering in and out like a dying neon sign. After a deep dive into the hardware, I realize it's not the sensor itself - though the power units are running on fumes. Turns out some rogue code was causing the malfunction. Half an hour of furious typing later, I've squashed the bug. Now the temp should beam straight to my HUD, clear as the corporate skyline on a rare smog-free day.
