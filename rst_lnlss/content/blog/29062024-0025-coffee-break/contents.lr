Neon-lit streets beckoned as I jacked out for a caffeine fix. Ten meters from my local synthbrew joint, I clocked a chrome-armed suit about to hurl something. My wetware kicked into overdrive, adrenaline surging. My Provessor implant ran threat assessment, calculating trajectories faster than meat-thought could process.
False alarm. The suit was just rage-quitting his PDA, smashing corp property like it was going out of style. Crisis averted, I ghosted past and scored my fix - black as the Net and twice as wired.

Earlier, I'd spliced a custom hack into the corpo OS. Risky biz, but it turbocharged my workflow. Spent the whole day swimming through datastreams, tweaking code like a digital god.

Back in meatspace, I'm still waiting for my first real-world programming gig. For now, it's all sim-jobs and virtual grunt work.

Thought of the day: In this neon jungle, honesty's just another commodity. If you can lie without consequences, do it. Street cred comes to those who can spin a smart tale. It's the way of the world, omae. Just make sure your fabrications are as bulletproof as your firewall.
