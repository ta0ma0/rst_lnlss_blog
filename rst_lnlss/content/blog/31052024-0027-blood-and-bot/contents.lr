This morning, I hadn't yet charged up on caffeine when my smartphone buzzed. It was a call from the blood bank; they asked me to donate blood today. Alright, I'll gather my strength for tomorrow. I tapped the holographic map to call a taxi. It was a known driver, Trooper. All the way, he repeated propaganda takesâ€”I'd already tried to tune it out, just another bot. After arriving at the bank, another driver with upgraded brain chips picked me up. We laughed all the way; it was good.

Near home, I went to the drug store for iron-containing supplements to restore my blood, but it was closed due to problems with documents. No worries, I'll just head to the nearest one.

I wrote a little in the dead cyberpunk chat. Why call it dead? People are just depressed and jaded; I can't do much about it.

Deal of the day: Do what you want, don't do what you don't want. Amen.
