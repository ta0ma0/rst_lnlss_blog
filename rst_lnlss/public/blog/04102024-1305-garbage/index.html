</div><p>I jacked into a corpo's recruitment node today. Hate their guts, but a netrunner's gotta eat. The black market's been dry lately, and I'm not ready to dive into the high-risk jobs. I ain't no all-or-nothing type – that's just cheap simstim fodder.</p>
<p>The test was pure brainscan garbage. Aced most of it, but the final task? Record a vidclip on why I "love finance." Pathetic corp-rats. Should've flipped 'em the bird right there on cam. They're like some alien species, not even human anymore.</p>
<p>Next cycle, I hit up my local street doc. Got some advice on rewiring my wetware, fine-tuning those neurotransmitter dials. Today's runtime feels smoother. Here's hoping it'll give me the edge to claw my way out of this cesspool.</p>
<p>Thought of the cycle: This world's wired wrong. No meat puppet can feel right naturally. It's not built for living, just surviving.</p>
