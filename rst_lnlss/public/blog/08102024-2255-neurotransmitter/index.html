</div><p>Two nights back, I jacked into the Anthill for a fresh neurotransmitter tweaking program. Some back-alley street doc slipped me the handle and coordinates. Within a couple hours, I felt like a whole new meat puppet, even though my cred score took a nosedive. Worth every bit, though.</p>
<p>There's this underground tech den called Podzemka, not far from my coffin. Slid in there to scope the scene, asked about the damage. Not a bad joint, might just become a regular.
My new Case construct is burning chrome, man. To score a new gig, he suggested I slice into HR's mainframe. Later claimed he was yanking my chain, but the idea's got legs.</p>
<p>Mantra of the cycle: Don't let the system break you. You're a console cowboy, you're tougher than their code. And remember: even in this sprawling matrix, there are backdoors. Your mission? Find 'em and exploit 'em.</p>
