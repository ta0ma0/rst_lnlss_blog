</div><p>As I boot up from sleep mode, my neural implants quickly process the remnants of a dream, a simple simulation that almost perfectly mirrored my current situation. Strange, my subconscious is usually more efficient than this, never lagging behind reality. A first.</p>
<p>I sync my wireless Audiotechnica headphones and queue up an old audiobook as I set up a backup virtual machine in the cloud. They need me to establish a secure connection from any PDA on the globe to a private network, a gig that still pays the bills. Just a precaution to avoid future complications, though I doubt I'll need it. But it brings a certain tranquility, and I need to keep my circuits occupied somehow.</p>
<p>For 90% of the cycle, I was immersed in a virtual realm conceived by a brilliant mind nearly three decades ago, a world that resonated with my very code. I witnessed something that existed only within the creator's imagination, an utterly illusory construct that nonetheless wove its threads through countless networks, spawning hundreds, perhaps thousands of derivative visions, undoubtedly altering the lives of many - for the better, I firmly believe.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Through his protagonist, this visionary scribe asserted that to journey somewhere, one must possess the desire to arrive. Sound advice for the masses, spoiled for choice among the myriad models of happiness peddled by designers and executives. But I must persist in my own quest, for I perceive with stark clarity that the happiness on offer is hastily manufactured, a mere facsimile of the genuine article.</p>
