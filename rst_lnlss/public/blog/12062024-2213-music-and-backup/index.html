</div><p>I jolted awake, my neural implants syncing with the grid. A quick scan of my surroundings revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The neon glow of the city seeped through the cracks in the blinds, but the silence was deafening. I drifted back into a dreamless sleep, only to be roused hours later by the incessant pinging of my biometric monitors. The readouts confirmed I was still alive, my vitals stable. I stumbled out of bed, desperate for a hit of synthcaf to kickstart my system.</p>
<p>The pulsing beat of electronic music was the only thing that could penetrate the fog of my mind. Thoughts of venturing out into the gritty streets flickered and died, crumbling to pixels in the face of apathy.</p>
<p>As night fell, the power grid faltered, plunging the city into darkness. My backup generators hummed to life, keeping my critical systems online. But some subroutines failed to initialize, forcing me to dive into the tangled web of code to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: I think we have reached a technological singularity, but we don’t understand it, new chips and technologies are appearing, but forums and news are shouting that we have no idea how to use it, let’s buy it, and then think for yourself why you need it.</p>
