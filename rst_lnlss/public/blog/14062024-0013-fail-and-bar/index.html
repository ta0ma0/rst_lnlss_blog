</div><p>Another cycle in the sprawl, and my tech's taken a hit. My top-of-the-line auditory enhancers are glitching out, one side dead as a fried circuit. No fix-it joints within a megaclick radius, but I've got a backup pair stashed, so it's not a total loss.</p>
<p>Mused on it earlier, plugged into a meetup on graphical neural nets. Thought it might spark something, but it was a dud. Starting to feel like this whole city's a ghost town when it comes to finding anyone on my wavelength.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Makes me wonder when I started expecting so much from the meatbags around me that reality keeps coming up short. Do I keep lowering the bar till there's nothing left? What's that leave me with - something I can still call human? And what about the others out there, the ones I've heard whispers of, operating on a level so far beyond my own it might as well be another universe?</p>
