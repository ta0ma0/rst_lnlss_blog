</div><p>I jack into the Grid, my consciousness streaming through neon-lit data corridors until I materialize in the virtual sprawl. The city's a patchwork of corporate adverts and holographic billboards, their glare reflecting off the wet streets. I drift through the crowd, faceless avatars brushing past me.</p>
<p>In a grimy alley, I stumble upon a Chinese street food joint. The air's thick with the scent of synthetic spices. I slide onto a stool at the bar, watching the patrons. Three cookie-cutter corpo-types cycle through: sit, sip, swipe, leave. Typical NPC behavior.
Then she walks in. Flaming red hair, emerald optics gleaming like polished chrome. She's different, moves with purpose. "Who are you?" I ask, not expecting a response from what should be just another script.</p>
<p>She turns, fixing me with that emerald gaze. "It doesn't matter," she says, voice low and smoky. She settles her tab and vanishes into the neon-soaked night. Definitely not an NPC. Tomorrow, I'll hunt for her again in this digital labyrinth. She's something... more.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: 3.18 creds left on my chip. Synth meat and pasta from the automat again. The system's rigged to keep you grinding for rep, stuck in your cubicle-sized apartment. But there's gotta be another way. Just need to think outside the black ice...</p>
