</div><p>I drift through the neon-lit datastreams, my custom-coded bots scouring the underbelly of the net for job leads. They ping my neural interface with potential gigs, and I fire back responses, occasionally setting up meets in grimy noodle bars or smoky VR lounges. Without this automation, I'd be trapped in an endless loop, trawling through corpo job boards. The economy's in the gutter, but a street samurai's gotta eat.</p>
<p>Some chrome-plated asshole with more implants than brain cells banned me from a lucrative data stream. Fuck 'em. I've got bigger fish to fry in this digital ocean.
Had to hustle hard and divert some creds to recalibrate my brain chemistry. The daily grind was wearing me down, and hitting the synthalcohol was like slapping a patch on a severed artery - when you peel it off, the blood flows even harder.</p>
<p>Thought of the cycle: You start to realize that even your flesh and blood are just using you, another cog in their machine. At first, it stings like a faulty wire, but then comes the cold comfort. In this neon jungle, everyone's out for themselves, feeding off the scraps tossed by the puppet masters in their high-rise havens.</p>
