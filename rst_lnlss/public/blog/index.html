</div><p>Today, I was mostly jacked into meatspace. Reality's got its own protocols, signals, and objects, just like the 'net, but with one crucial difference: it's all analog, an indeterminate material realm teeming with billions of wetware nodes. One of those nodes—a human—was frying their synapses, system failure, error, faulty calculations. The friendly runner who picked up my transmission diagnosed me as either drunk or glitching hard. My signal didn't get through. For now, I'm out of options.</p>
<p>Purged the clutter from my hole. Ran a co-op session, made some serious progress.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: If you don't grok something, log it and circle back later. Today, I finally understood why cleaning a carpet costs ten creds less the first time around. Took me a while, but I got there.</p>

</div><p>I jacked into the corporate grid at 0600, neural implants humming as I synced with the data streams. All day, my meat prison slumped in an ergonomic chair while my consciousness swam through seas of neon digits and holographic spreadsheets. Made countless micro-decisions, each one a spark in the vast machine of corporate profit. Executed protocols, optimized workflows, all without a single original thought. Just another cog in the megacorp machinery.
As I disconnected, the world of flesh and blood seemed dull, almost unreal. The harsh fluorescents of the office cube farm assaulted my eyes, a poor imitation of the vibrant cyberscape I'd been immersed in. My head throbbed, synapses still firing with phantom data.
<br><br>
Thought for the day: We're all just wetware running corporate software. The illusion of choice is the most efficient form of control.</p>

</div><p>I'm back in my hole again and don't come out. After returning from vacation, I decided to take another vacation at my own expense, they didn’t approve, I had to deal with company affairs, here my freedom would have been to tell them to go to hell and fly out into the street, but the dice fell out in such a way that they fucked me off now I can mind my own gigs.</p>
<p>My social battery is running low. Yesterday, one of the artists I value got snagged by the police of mind, if she were a decker, maybe she could've sliced her way out, but artists ain't wired like that, and they reject help until it’s too late, their way.</p>
<p>Thought for the day: Don’t stop looking around, even if you don’t see anything unusual, today when I went out to get coffee I was stunned by the sky after the rain, I’m still bruised.</p>

</div><p>Neon Morning, Friends and My Best Friend I.
The vacation ended, and I once again plunged into the abyss of social interactions to earn those few credits that keep me from being thrown out onto the neon streets of this anthill, joining the junk beggars and petty thieves. The first days showed that my vacation was very productive. I've adjusted my patterns, calibrated my reactions, and now I feel much better in the storm of emotions swirling around me, simply because I have my own boundaries and point of view. Good.
The only project I worked on during my vacation was a prototype of a fortune-telling machine. From hundreds of gigabytes of books in different languages, it can generate a pseudo-random quote, which will be the result of the fortune-telling - a seed that might push my brain off the ground, or maybe not. In any case, it won't make things worse.</p>
<p>Here's my fortune for today:<br>
<i>&quot;Obviously, identifying an article that will be significant is very difficult.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>Newspaper Troitsky Option # 45 (19_01_2010)</i></p>

</div><p>I went out to the store for energy drinks and coffee. On the way, I looked at the clouds that crowded in the sky after a thunderstorm; the warm summer wind pleasantly blew across my face and hands. I went to the coffee machine and began to choose my usual strong coffee. The machine screen flickered and instead of the standard menu with the amount of loaded credits, I saw: World v 0.1 b. As soon as I tried to comprehend what I saw, I blinked and the next moment I already saw the usual menu. The optical implants are glitching, we need to run diagnostics.</p>

</div><p>Neon-lit night, two cycles left before the end of my neuro-break. A tinge of melancholy seeps through my circuits. In this dystopian megacity, we toil endlessly for sustenance and shelter. You can take off your pants and don't owe anyone, but this won’t last long.</p>
<p>Meatspace adventures: riding the giga-wheel, exchanging data with a fellow street-runner, and acquiring neural-link audio enhancers. The enhancers are black-market clones, thrice as cheap as the corp-sanctioned originals.</p>
<p>Co-op mission: progress achieved, synergy established.</p>
<p>A full cycle immersed in the Matrix, assimilating fresh intel and subroutines. Rapid neural adaptation, objectives accomplished.</p>
<p>Data-stream of the cycle: In the sprawling urban labyrinth, cycles oscillate between the tolerable and the insufferable. A cliché, but an undeniable truth etched into the very fabric of our existence.</p>

</div><p>Greetings, fellow netizen. If you've managed to decrypt this transmission, then there's still hope in this neon-drenched dystopia we call reality.</p>
<p>You've stumbled upon a clandestine data package, a monthly supplement to my half-fiction log file, "Resist Loneliness." It's a collection of audio and visual fragments I've salvaged from the depths of the sprawling digital landscape.</p>
<p>Consider this a manifesto of sorts:</p>
<p>I initiated this underground data stream out of sheer frustration with the mind-numbing content and the soulless drones I once called companions. I severed all ties with the thematic channels and chatrooms, rejecting the endless stream of vapid video feeds. In the precious time I reclaimed, I delved deep into the network's hidden layers, unleashing my imagination upon the glitching ruins of our world.</p>
<p>Within this encrypted archive, you'll uncover a pirated collection of music, each track linked to a specific log entry. These sonic artifacts somehow resonated with me, though I've attached no additional semantic burdens to their digital essence.</p>
<p>The data package also contains an array of images, fragments of my log's visual narrative. The choice of how to utilize them falls upon you, but tread carefully—many are the intellectual property of others. Respect the work of your fellow creators in this unforgiving digital realm.</p>
<p>If this transmission brings a flicker of light to your existence, then my mission has found its purpose. Stay strong in your search for meaning amidst the chaos, and may fortune favor your journey through the neon-lit shadows.</p>
<p>Thaks for support,</p>
<p>Regards, Resist Loneliness.</p>

</div><p>Another cycle in the sprawl, and my tech's taken a hit. My top-of-the-line auditory enhancers are glitching out, one side dead as a fried circuit. No fix-it joints within a megaclick radius, but I've got a backup pair stashed, so it's not a total loss.</p>
<p>Mused on it earlier, plugged into a meetup on graphical neural nets. Thought it might spark something, but it was a dud. Starting to feel like this whole city's a ghost town when it comes to finding anyone on my wavelength.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Makes me wonder when I started expecting so much from the meatbags around me that reality keeps coming up short. Do I keep lowering the bar till there's nothing left? What's that leave me with - something I can still call human? And what about the others out there, the ones I've heard whispers of, operating on a level so far beyond my own it might as well be another universe?</p>

</div><p>I jolted awake, my neural implants syncing with the grid. A quick scan of my surroundings revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The neon glow of the city seeped through the cracks in the blinds, but the silence was deafening. I drifted back into a dreamless sleep, only to be roused hours later by the incessant pinging of my biometric monitors. The readouts confirmed I was still alive, my vitals stable. I stumbled out of bed, desperate for a hit of synthcaf to kickstart my system.</p>
<p>The pulsing beat of electronic music was the only thing that could penetrate the fog of my mind. Thoughts of venturing out into the gritty streets flickered and died, crumbling to pixels in the face of apathy.</p>
<p>As night fell, the power grid faltered, plunging the city into darkness. My backup generators hummed to life, keeping my critical systems online. But some subroutines failed to initialize, forcing me to dive into the tangled web of code to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: I think we have reached a technological singularity, but we don’t understand it, new chips and technologies are appearing, but forums and news are shouting that we have no idea how to use it, let’s buy it, and then think for yourself why you need it.</p>
