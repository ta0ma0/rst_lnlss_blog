<p>Yeah, I’m still here. Ghost in the bandwidth. Jamming these pulses into the datastream like a half-burnt ICE-jockey waiting on a miracle.</p>
<p>Things turned out way deeper and dirtier than the sim promised. Since the last drop, I haven’t landed a single contract. Zero creds. No chatter from the fixers. Just dead nodes and cold echoes. I jacked out, fell back to my spawn-point, holed up in my crashpad among the last crumbs of synthetic luxury. And even that’s glitching out—fast.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’ve got a plan. Blueprinted in caffeine, paranoia, and old legends. But I need a job to grease the gears. Just like every retro-dystopian tale we mainlined in the smoggy neon nights of our youth. A lone runner, down and out, parked in the gutter of the Net, scraping static.</p>
<p>But here’s the rub: my chrome’s still humming. No bugs. No backdoors. I might be low, but I’m not out. Not yet.</p>
<p>Cycle's Thought Upload:
You thought things were bad?
You weren’t wrong.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, if you’re still tuned in.</p>
