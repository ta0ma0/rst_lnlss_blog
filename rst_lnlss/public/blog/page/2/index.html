</div><p>Greetings, fellow netizen. If you've managed to decrypt this transmission, then there's still hope in this neon-drenched dystopia we call reality.</p>
<p>You've stumbled upon a clandestine data package, a monthly supplement to my half-fiction log file, "Resist Loneliness." It's a collection of audio and visual fragments I've salvaged from the depths of the sprawling digital landscape.</p>
<p>Consider this a manifesto of sorts:</p>
<p>I initiated this underground data stream out of sheer frustration with the mind-numbing content and the soulless drones I once called companions. I severed all ties with the thematic channels and chatrooms, rejecting the endless stream of vapid video feeds. In the precious time I reclaimed, I delved deep into the network's hidden layers, unleashing my imagination upon the glitching ruins of our world.</p>
<p>Within this encrypted archive, you'll uncover a pirated collection of music, each track linked to a specific log entry. These sonic artifacts somehow resonated with me, though I've attached no additional semantic burdens to their digital essence.</p>
<p>The data package also contains an array of images, fragments of my log's visual narrative. The choice of how to utilize them falls upon you, but tread carefully—many are the intellectual property of others. Respect the work of your fellow creators in this unforgiving digital realm.</p>
<p>If this transmission brings a flicker of light to your existence, then my mission has found its purpose. Stay strong in your search for meaning amidst the chaos, and may fortune favor your journey through the neon-lit shadows.</p>
<p>Thaks for support,</p>
<p>Regards, Resist Loneliness.</p>

</div><p>Another cycle in the sprawl, and my tech's taken a hit. My top-of-the-line auditory enhancers are glitching out, one side dead as a fried circuit. No fix-it joints within a megaclick radius, but I've got a backup pair stashed, so it's not a total loss.</p>
<p>Mused on it earlier, plugged into a meetup on graphical neural nets. Thought it might spark something, but it was a dud. Starting to feel like this whole city's a ghost town when it comes to finding anyone on my wavelength.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Makes me wonder when I started expecting so much from the meatbags around me that reality keeps coming up short. Do I keep lowering the bar till there's nothing left? What's that leave me with - something I can still call human? And what about the others out there, the ones I've heard whispers of, operating on a level so far beyond my own it might as well be another universe?</p>

</div><p>I jolted awake, my neural implants syncing with the grid. A quick scan of my surroundings revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The neon glow of the city seeped through the cracks in the blinds, but the silence was deafening. I drifted back into a dreamless sleep, only to be roused hours later by the incessant pinging of my biometric monitors. The readouts confirmed I was still alive, my vitals stable. I stumbled out of bed, desperate for a hit of synthcaf to kickstart my system.</p>
<p>The pulsing beat of electronic music was the only thing that could penetrate the fog of my mind. Thoughts of venturing out into the gritty streets flickered and died, crumbling to pixels in the face of apathy.</p>
<p>As night fell, the power grid faltered, plunging the city into darkness. My backup generators hummed to life, keeping my critical systems online. But some subroutines failed to initialize, forcing me to dive into the tangled web of code to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: I think we have reached a technological singularity, but we don’t understand it, new chips and technologies are appearing, but forums and news are shouting that we have no idea how to use it, let’s buy it, and then think for yourself why you need it.</p>

</div><p>As I boot up from sleep mode, my neural implants quickly process the remnants of a dream, a simple simulation that almost perfectly mirrored my current situation. Strange, my subconscious is usually more efficient than this, never lagging behind reality. A first.</p>
<p>I sync my wireless Audiotechnica headphones and queue up an old audiobook as I set up a backup virtual machine in the cloud. They need me to establish a secure connection from any PDA on the globe to a private network, a gig that still pays the bills. Just a precaution to avoid future complications, though I doubt I'll need it. But it brings a certain tranquility, and I need to keep my circuits occupied somehow.</p>
<p>For 90% of the cycle, I was immersed in a virtual realm conceived by a brilliant mind nearly three decades ago, a world that resonated with my very code. I witnessed something that existed only within the creator's imagination, an utterly illusory construct that nonetheless wove its threads through countless networks, spawning hundreds, perhaps thousands of derivative visions, undoubtedly altering the lives of many - for the better, I firmly believe.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: Through his protagonist, this visionary scribe asserted that to journey somewhere, one must possess the desire to arrive. Sound advice for the masses, spoiled for choice among the myriad models of happiness peddled by designers and executives. But I must persist in my own quest, for I perceive with stark clarity that the happiness on offer is hastily manufactured, a mere facsimile of the genuine article.</p>

</div><p>Morning. I opened my eyes and glanced at my neurotransmitter levels and to-do list. Next to each item, a red "insufficient motivation" warning icon flashed. I closed my eyes again and fell into an even deeper, dreamless sleep. Waking up late in the afternoon, I was convinced that the levels hadn't changed, but I pulled myself out of bed anyway.</p>
<p>I turned on the emergency power supply and brewed coffee from my emergency stash, lacking the strength to venture to the machine on the street. The servos began to hum, and I mustered the energy to perform daily maintenance and cleaning. Time to move on.</p>
<p>Before leaving my apartment, I always check for an agent's car parked outside my window. Before opening the door, I scan the space in front of it—my usual ritual. They might still be hunting me, even though the sensors have been silent for a long time. In this world, vigilance is a constant necessity.</p>
<p>The machine-made coffee restarted my internal mechanisms, and I'm alive again. I need to deal with this. A request to the AI provided me with the following list:</p>
<p>Dopamine
Serotonin
Norepinephrine
Oxytocin
Endorphins
Cortisol</p>
<p>The problem lies here. I messaged my chemist; we'll see how many credits it will cost me and figure out the next steps.</p>
<p>Thought for the day: Even when you don't have enough energy for anything, there's always some minimal action you can take. You need to think and do it. Maybe this small step will lead to a more level playing field, as it did for me today.</p>

</div><p>The neon lights pierce the night sky like a shot, injecting with a dose of electric brilliance. My neural implants finally grant me a moment. I drag myself out of bed, slip on my shades, and stumble towards the coffee machine. The morning caffeine hit surges through my veins, a welcome jolt to my system. The faint scent of gasoline lingers in the kitchen-turned-workshop, a remnant of yesterday's Zippo repair session.
I need to compile the documentation files after configuring the ZNC bouncer, ensuring that next time I won't have to scour the net for instructions. It's a simple task, but the documentation keeps me occupied, focused.</p>
<p>Today, the runners and I tackled a co-op mission, making significant progress. Our shared triumph is a source of encouragement.</p>
<p>The rest of the day is spent pondering new projects, creating backups, and grappling with the nagging suspicion that something crucial is missing, hindering my progress. The exact nature of this obstacle eludes me, for now.</p>
<p>Beyond the window, the world ceases to exist. I pay it no mind, as it neither bothers nor interferes with my existence. It's perfect, in its own way. My online village, a digital commune where everyone shares everything—mostly memes and good vibes—is all I need.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: We overestimate our influence on those closest to us. In reality, no one truly influences anyone. If your friend descends into madness, you are powerless to help them. We are too self-absorbed, too distrustful of others to make a real difference.</p>

</div><p>I'm on Earth in the Mountains, a country connected to the global data highway. But in the net-sector, it's just a pixel, nothing seeming important. All the better for me - less regulations, almost free. In the sector I relocated from, the net lost connectivity. That's not acceptable for me. I know how to bypass walls and firewalls, but I prefer to walk freely, to breathe, to inhale free bytes.</p>
<p>There are fewer augmented people here than anywhere else. People prefer clean bodies, and this is good. The thoughtless use of implants is spreading epidemics of cyberpsychosis and increasing the number of unpredictable glitches. I'm running towards reasonable predictability.
Access to the network doesn't become faster or more brilliant if you do it from a 500-level skyscraper. The same access can be had from a building built from natural tuff, a material used here even before the invention of the first stone highways for wheeled transport.</p>
<p>Access to chips and hardware is somewhat slower, but the space is saturated with a large number of earlier hardware models at an affordable price, which is quite enough for my activities. And if you need the latest sparkling chrome, then a proxy is at your service.</p>
<p>It's important to note the low level of police corruption and their good equipment. This ensures that there are no unwanted problems from unexpected quarters. To get these problems, you need to try very hard or behave completely crazy. It's good, good. No one bothers you here.</p>

</div><p>In the neon-drenched morning, I ventured to the post office to retrieve a package containing my single board computer. The city's pulse thrummed through the streets, a symphony of data streams and electric dreams.</p>
<p>Upon powering up the rig, it failed to materialize in my net. A challenge, indeed, but one I relished. After all, it's why I sought them out—to sink my teeth into the problems they presented. I ran through the usual diagnostics: checking the path cord, resetting the router. No dice. Time to start from scratch.
I slotted in a fresh SD, rolled out a new OS, tweaked the settings. Viola! The rig hummed to life, its circuits singing in perfect harmony. A twinge of disappointment flickered through me; with the issue resolved, I found myself without a puzzle to unravel.</p>
<p>My mind's eye wandered over my hardware array, assessing its capabilities, yearning for a project to sink into. But what I lacked was a clear-cut task, a problem with a specific endgame and, of course, a surefire payoff. Without that, my brain refused to engage. It's a tale as old as Edison himself—one invention every seven years. My case was far from unique in this neon-soaked world.
A thought flickered through my mind, a glimmer of insight amidst the city's digital haze: If you leave your change behind in one coffee machine, let your worries drift away on the data streams. In fifteen minutes, you'll find it waiting for you in another, a small treasure in this labyrinthine metropolis.</p>

</div><p>Neon mornings with earbuds on, jacking into my favorite brunch spot. I grab a quick hit of oxytocin from my runners and a shot of spirits to wake up the grown-up in me. I may not have an experienced medical chemist on call, but I try to maintain the balance of my neurotransmitters by any means available. Friendly communication is fine, but sometimes it's a burden, both for me and others. That's just how people function in this world.</p>
<p>I decide to grab breakfast at the most likely cafe, run by double emigrants who've made a full cycle of resettlement, fleeing from the eternal war of dictators. The food is delicious, and the owner throws in a small gift of ice cream. Good stuff.
My approach to life is controlled chaos. I calculate the probability and call my driver, requesting a route to one of the ancient churches. Gotcha. We drive along the road to our destination, passing ancient rocks and ruins. I take a moment to drink cold, natural water from what's probably a sacred source, going off-grid to think without thinking. Finally, we return safely.</p>
<p>A quick check of my deck's RAM shows everything is in order. I browse the runners' forum for project examples that might lead to my next gig.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: We can't calculate everything. Sometimes, we have to make decisions using heuristic algorithms.</p>

</div><p>I'm jacked into my rig, immersed in the neon-soaked beats of the music world. No need to venture out into the gritty streets. A few small gigs keep me from flatlinning, but I need more, always scanning for contracts. The job market's a fraggin' mess, too many desperate souls and not enough work to go around. Freelancing? Gotta update my profile and keep a closer eye on the net, but I ain't got the drive for that yet. My mind's always buzzing, searchin' for the next big score, a project to call my own.</p>
<p>Today's my birthday, but ain't no reason to celebrate. Might link up with some fellow runners for a quick meet. Scored a sushi set called Akira, named after that legendary anime. Heh, the irony.</p>
