So, here's the log entry. Armenia, post-mobilization reality. The meat attacks didn't break me, I'm still in the game. Semi-legal cash flow from a remote location, a trusty laptop with access to the office network and the ability to get electronics - these are my arsenal.<br>
<br>
Thoughts, dark and light, swarm in my head. I don’t suppress them, let consciousness grow freely. One of these thoughts is scam. Thousands of fake online stores, money for non-existent goods. But a moral compass does not allow you to go astray.<br>
<br>
The light side took over. I created several websites for local shopkeepers, put on a formal biker jacket, and went to convince. But the Armenian infosphere is a separate universe, under the wing of Meta. Backup options? Did not hear. Thousands of years of history are probably to blame.<br>
<br>
Today: the coffee machine at the supermarket malfunctioned just as I was rushing to a Lethal Company co-op session with two guys from the net. The money was returned, but the coffee had to be taken in backup.
The gaming session is fire. The work phone was silent, two hours of pure fun with the guys.<br>
<br>
The dual boot laptop is buggy. Three freezes in Windows, once dead. I suspect the memory bar, but haven't gotten around to checking it yet.
rekt.network continues to provide excellent soundtracks. A couple more energy drinks and I'm back in business. The contours of a new project loom on the horizon.</p>
