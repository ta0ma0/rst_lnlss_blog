</div><p>The neon lights pierce the night sky like a shot, injecting with a dose of electric brilliance. My neural implants finally grant me a moment. I drag myself out of bed, slip on my shades, and stumble towards the coffee machine. The morning caffeine hit surges through my veins, a welcome jolt to my system. The faint scent of gasoline lingers in the kitchen-turned-workshop, a remnant of yesterday's Zippo repair session.
I need to compile the documentation files after configuring the ZNC bouncer, ensuring that next time I won't have to scour the net for instructions. It's a simple task, but the documentation keeps me occupied, focused.</p>
<p>Today, the runners and I tackled a co-op mission, making significant progress. Our shared triumph is a source of encouragement.</p>
<p>The rest of the day is spent pondering new projects, creating backups, and grappling with the nagging suspicion that something crucial is missing, hindering my progress. The exact nature of this obstacle eludes me, for now.</p>
<p>Beyond the window, the world ceases to exist. I pay it no mind, as it neither bothers nor interferes with my existence. It's perfect, in its own way. My online village, a digital commune where everyone shares everything—mostly memes and good vibes—is all I need.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: We overestimate our influence on those closest to us. In reality, no one truly influences anyone. If your friend descends into madness, you are powerless to help them. We are too self-absorbed, too distrustful of others to make a real difference.</p>

</div><p>I'm on Earth in the Mountains, a country connected to the global data highway. But in the net-sector, it's just a pixel, nothing seeming important. All the better for me - less regulations, almost free. In the sector I relocated from, the net lost connectivity. That's not acceptable for me. I know how to bypass walls and firewalls, but I prefer to walk freely, to breathe, to inhale free bytes.</p>
<p>There are fewer augmented people here than anywhere else. People prefer clean bodies, and this is good. The thoughtless use of implants is spreading epidemics of cyberpsychosis and increasing the number of unpredictable glitches. I'm running towards reasonable predictability.
Access to the network doesn't become faster or more brilliant if you do it from a 500-level skyscraper. The same access can be had from a building built from natural tuff, a material used here even before the invention of the first stone highways for wheeled transport.</p>
<p>Access to chips and hardware is somewhat slower, but the space is saturated with a large number of earlier hardware models at an affordable price, which is quite enough for my activities. And if you need the latest sparkling chrome, then a proxy is at your service.</p>
<p>It's important to note the low level of police corruption and their good equipment. This ensures that there are no unwanted problems from unexpected quarters. To get these problems, you need to try very hard or behave completely crazy. It's good, good. No one bothers you here.</p>

</div><p>In the neon-drenched morning, I ventured to the post office to retrieve a package containing my single board computer. The city's pulse thrummed through the streets, a symphony of data streams and electric dreams.</p>
<p>Upon powering up the rig, it failed to materialize in my net. A challenge, indeed, but one I relished. After all, it's why I sought them out—to sink my teeth into the problems they presented. I ran through the usual diagnostics: checking the path cord, resetting the router. No dice. Time to start from scratch.
I slotted in a fresh SD, rolled out a new OS, tweaked the settings. Viola! The rig hummed to life, its circuits singing in perfect harmony. A twinge of disappointment flickered through me; with the issue resolved, I found myself without a puzzle to unravel.</p>
<p>My mind's eye wandered over my hardware array, assessing its capabilities, yearning for a project to sink into. But what I lacked was a clear-cut task, a problem with a specific endgame and, of course, a surefire payoff. Without that, my brain refused to engage. It's a tale as old as Edison himself—one invention every seven years. My case was far from unique in this neon-soaked world.
A thought flickered through my mind, a glimmer of insight amidst the city's digital haze: If you leave your change behind in one coffee machine, let your worries drift away on the data streams. In fifteen minutes, you'll find it waiting for you in another, a small treasure in this labyrinthine metropolis.</p>

  </div>
</div><p>Neon mornings with earbuds on, jacking into my favorite brunch spot. I grab a quick hit of oxytocin from my runners and a shot of spirits to wake up the grown-up in me. I may not have an experienced medical chemist on call, but I try to maintain the balance of my neurotransmitters by any means available. Friendly communication is fine, but sometimes it's a burden, both for me and others. That's just how people function in this world.</p>
<p>I decide to grab breakfast at the most likely cafe, run by double emigrants who've made a full cycle of resettlement, fleeing from the eternal war of dictators. The food is delicious, and the owner throws in a small gift of ice cream. Good stuff.
My approach to life is controlled chaos. I calculate the probability and call my driver, requesting a route to one of the ancient churches. Gotcha. We drive along the road to our destination, passing ancient rocks and ruins. I take a moment to drink cold, natural water from what's probably a sacred source, going off-grid to think without thinking. Finally, we return safely.</p>
<p>A quick check of my deck's RAM shows everything is in order. I browse the runners' forum for project examples that might lead to my next gig.</p>
<p>Thought of the day: We can't calculate everything. Sometimes, we have to make decisions using heuristic algorithms.</p>

</div><p>I'm jacked into my rig, immersed in the neon-soaked beats of the music world. No need to venture out into the gritty streets. A few small gigs keep me from flatlinning, but I need more, always scanning for contracts. The job market's a fraggin' mess, too many desperate souls and not enough work to go around. Freelancing? Gotta update my profile and keep a closer eye on the net, but I ain't got the drive for that yet. My mind's always buzzing, searchin' for the next big score, a project to call my own.</p>
<p>Today's my birthday, but ain't no reason to celebrate. Might link up with some fellow runners for a quick meet. Scored a sushi set called Akira, named after that legendary anime. Heh, the irony.</p>
<p>A runner once told me: Don't leave the room, don't make a mistake.</p>

</div><p>Zippo Fuel Crisis
Got a Zippo lighter, but no Zippo fuel. Tried 97% alcohol, solvent, nothing worked. Might need to hit the gas station. I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>ATM Malfunction
Morning update: ATM card's busted. Gotta grab cash from the office. Time to renew the card? At least prices aren't surging. NFC to the rescue.</p>
<p>Video Stream Conversion
Found a slick program for real-time video stream conversion. Snag a source, layer on effects, route it to another output and beam it across the Net. Feels like Linux.
Birthday Bash</p>
<p>Birthday party time. My old friend's gone off the grid. Probably couldn't find the right meds. New faces from some corner of the Net showed up instead.</p>
<p>AI Access Request
In a restricted sector with no free AI access, they're asking for a way in. Gotta ponder that one.</p>

</div><p>In this neon-drenched hellhole of a town, there ain't a single chips and micro-electronics store to be found. All I need is a simple 3.5 jack connector for my headphones, but I'm stuck soldering this piece of junk together with scrap metal and duct tape. Four hours of my life, gone. I might have to jack into the capital's grid and see what I can scrounge up, but that's a problem for another day. Got a few backup plans up my sleeve.</p>
<p>Linked up with some runners in the chat, setting up a Jitsi for a virtual meet. Ran into some dependency issues, but I'm a quick thinker. Found a workaround and got it installed. I'm wired in now.</p>
<p>Jacked into a co-op game for a couple of hours. We tore through the forest, leaving a trail of pixelated animal carcasses in our wake. Racked up the points until the spawn rate couldn't keep up. Saved our progress and jacked out.</p>
<p>Today's truth: In this fast-paced, neon-lit world, planning years ahead is a fool's game. Life's got a way of jamming your circuits and frying your plans. Best to strap on your headphones, crank up the tunes, and ride the wave wherever it takes you.</p>

Gotta stay juiced and connected out here. Transfer complete. Load up my favorite synth-wave tracks onto the PDA for untethered audio bliss.</p>
<p>Tomorrow need repair my headphones, music it's my air, I'm is audio junke.</p>
<p>Jack into the net for some co-op gaming with a couple of rogue runners I linked up with in the dark alleys of cyberspace.</p>

</div><p>The neon glow of the city seeped through the cracks of my blinds as I jolted awake, my neural implant buzzing before the caffeine hit my system. The holographic display of my phone flashed, revealing the face of my apartment's AI administrator demanding the monthly payment. I stumbled to the ATM, only to find my cred-chip malfunctioning. Forced to withdraw physical cash from the office, I made my way to the electronic store, driven by an inexplicable urge to acquire a mini-computer running Android OS. Despite my preference for Linux, the allure of Android's sleek interface proved irresistible.</p>
<p>Upon returning home, reality struck me like a glitch in the matrix—today was Friday, a working day, not the liberation of Saturday I had initially believed. A bittersweet realization washed over me; while the corporate machine had not yet fully consumed my mind, its grasp on my life was undeniable.</p>
<p>The revelation of the day hit me like a rogue lines of code: Social programming is not just a theory, but a tangible force shaping the very fabric of our society. I witnessed firsthand how those exposed to its influence transformed, their thoughts and actions molded by the invisible strings of the system.</p>

<p>This morning, I hadn't yet charged up on caffeine when my smartphone buzzed. It was a call from the blood bank; they asked me to donate blood today. Alright, I'll gather my strength for tomorrow. I tapped the holographic map to call a taxi. It was a known driver, Trooper. All the way, he repeated propaganda takes—I'd already tried to tune it out, just another bot. After arriving at the bank, another driver with upgraded brain chips picked me up. We laughed all the way; it was good.</p>
<p>Near home, I went to the drug store for iron-containing supplements to restore my blood, but it was closed due to problems with documents. No worries, I'll just head to the nearest one.</p>
<p>I wrote a little in the dead cyberpunk chat. Why call it dead? People are just depressed and jaded; I can't do much about it.</p>
<p>Deal of the day: Do what you want, don't do what you don't want. Amen.</p>
