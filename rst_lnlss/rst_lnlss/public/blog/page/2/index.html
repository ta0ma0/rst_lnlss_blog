</div><p>Zippo Fuel Crisis
Got a Zippo lighter, but no Zippo fuel. Tried 97% alcohol, solvent, nothing worked. Might need to hit the gas station. I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>ATM Malfunction
Morning update: ATM card's busted. Gotta grab cash from the office. Time to renew the card? At least prices aren't surging. NFC to the rescue.</p>
<p>Video Stream Conversion
Found a slick program for real-time video stream conversion. Snag a source, layer on effects, route it to another output and beam it across the Net. Feels like Linux.
Birthday Bash</p>
<p>Birthday party time. My old friend's gone off the grid. Probably couldn't find the right meds. New faces from some corner of the Net showed up instead.</p>
<p>AI Access Request
In a restricted sector with no free AI access, they're asking for a way in. Gotta ponder that one.</p>

</div><p>In this neon-drenched hellhole of a town, there ain't a single chips and micro-electronics store to be found. All I need is a simple 3.5 jack connector for my headphones, but I'm stuck soldering this piece of junk together with scrap metal and duct tape. Four hours of my life, gone. I might have to jack into the capital's grid and see what I can scrounge up, but that's a problem for another day. Got a few backup plans up my sleeve.</p>
<p>Linked up with some runners in the chat, setting up a Jitsi for a virtual meet. Ran into some dependency issues, but I'm a quick thinker. Found a workaround and got it installed. I'm wired in now.</p>
<p>Jacked into a co-op game for a couple of hours. We tore through the forest, leaving a trail of pixelated animal carcasses in our wake. Racked up the points until the spawn rate couldn't keep up. Saved our progress and jacked out.</p>
<p>Today's truth: In this fast-paced, neon-lit world, planning years ahead is a fool's game. Life's got a way of jamming your circuits and frying your plans. Best to strap on your headphones, crank up the tunes, and ride the wave wherever it takes you.</p>

</div><p>Neon-lit morning. Jacked into the grid, I navigate the sprawl to the electronic bazaar. Mission: score an SD-card for my PDA and accumulators for a DIY power bank kit. Gotta stay juiced and connected out here. Transfer complete. Load up my favorite synth-wave tracks onto the PDA for untethered audio bliss.</p>
<p>Tomorrow need repair my headphones, music it's my air, I'm is audio junke.</p>
<p>Jack into the net for some co-op gaming with a couple of rogue runners I linked up with in the dark alleys of cyberspace.</p>
<p>Time ticks on, each moment a digital drop in the ocean of existence. Boring or thrilling, it's all just data streaming by, an endless flow of binary indifference in the neon-drenched landscape of the sprawl.</p>

</div><p>The neon glow of the city seeped through the cracks of my blinds as I jolted awake, my neural implant buzzing before the caffeine hit my system. The holographic display of my phone flashed, revealing the face of my apartment's AI administrator demanding the monthly payment. I stumbled to the ATM, only to find my cred-chip malfunctioning. Forced to withdraw physical cash from the office, I made my way to the electronic store, driven by an inexplicable urge to acquire a mini-computer running Android OS. Despite my preference for Linux, the allure of Android's sleek interface proved irresistible.</p>
<p>Upon returning home, reality struck me like a glitch in the matrix—today was Friday, a working day, not the liberation of Saturday I had initially believed. A bittersweet realization washed over me; while the corporate machine had not yet fully consumed my mind, its grasp on my life was undeniable.</p>
<p>The revelation of the day hit me like a rogue lines of code: Social programming is not just a theory, but a tangible force shaping the very fabric of our society. I witnessed firsthand how those exposed to its influence transformed, their thoughts and actions molded by the invisible strings of the system.</p>

<p>This morning, I hadn't yet charged up on caffeine when my smartphone buzzed. It was a call from the blood bank; they asked me to donate blood today. Alright, I'll gather my strength for tomorrow. I tapped the holographic map to call a taxi. It was a known driver, Trooper. All the way, he repeated propaganda takes—I'd already tried to tune it out, just another bot. After arriving at the bank, another driver with upgraded brain chips picked me up. We laughed all the way; it was good.</p>
<p>Near home, I went to the drug store for iron-containing supplements to restore my blood, but it was closed due to problems with documents. No worries, I'll just head to the nearest one.</p>
<p>I wrote a little in the dead cyberpunk chat. Why call it dead? People are just depressed and jaded; I can't do much about it.</p>
<p>Deal of the day: Do what you want, don't do what you don't want. Amen.</p>

</div><p>In a gritty, neon-lit corner of Kingston, a lone hero emerged amidst the sprawling slums. Armed with nothing but discarded tech and an unwavering resolve, he assembled computers from spare parts and shared his knowledge with the children of the forgotten. In makeshift classrooms, he taught them to navigate the digital realm, to code their way out of poverty, and to sculpt their dreams in 3D.</p>
<p>It was 2019, a time when the IT labor market was a searing crucible of opportunity, and those who could bend computers to their will were the new gods. But now, as I type these words onto a flickering screen, the world has shifted. The once-privileged class of computer specialists has been reduced to mere cogs in the machine, their value no greater than that of an office drone.</p>
<p>The industry became a bloated beast, luring in the masses with promises of quick riches. They came in droves, hastily absorbing scraps of knowledge, only to turn on their own kind with sneers of superiority. It's a sickening sight, watching them cannibalize each other while the corporate overlords watch with glee.</p>
<p>But I digress. Those children in the computer club, they were supposed to be the future, their skills a shining path out of the darkness. Yet, as time has shown, perhaps they would have been better off learning the ancient arts of leatherwork or tending to the earth. For now, the gates to the hallowed halls of IT have slammed shut, and only those who entered before the great culling remain.</p>
<p>This is the harsh reality, a truth I know all too well. The once-free spirits of the programming world have been reduced to lab rats, endlessly running on a wheel, their eyes fixed on the next morsel that falls from the dispenser. It's a bleak picture, I know, but the signs were there for those who cared to look. Copeland saw it, all those years ago in "Generation X," and now we're living it.</p>
<p>Just today, I met with the apartment administrator, a man who sought my aid in fixing his computer. When I asked for a meager tablet in return, he spouted some nonsense about everyone helping each other without expectation. I laughed silently and walked away, knowing all too well that in this world, nothing comes for free.</p>

</div><p>I jack into the matrix and ping my Mom. In my parents' pad where I hosted last time, I still have my single-board rig and a souped-up wi-fi antenna. I need it, not sure why yet, but ideas spark when the gear's in front of me. I tell her to point the smartphone's eye at the table and mark where everything is. The package is en route, got a tracking number. Now, I wait.</p>
<p>Today, I hit up the proxy store to check on my order. leather bags canceled it, jacked up the price, and wanted me to confirm again. I rang them up and demanded a refund. Terrible service, but I've got a backup plan.</p>
<p>To keep my endorphins flowing, I hit the boxing gym on my lunch break. Showed up, but they sent us packing. I'll try again tomorrow.</p>
<p>What's the big deal today? Silence. I'm talking about the deafening silence and isolation in this society. Feels like everyone's flatlined, but I know they're still kicking. They just can't jack into the net.</p>

</div><p>Oh, endless Monday. Usually, I dig my gig, but not today. Today, I think my job mates left half their wetware at home. Fine, I set up smart alerts for this bloody hell mail client. To reduce the loneliness, I posted on a collective blog, but I can't stand the stupid and idle chatter. They don't need to know what I know, but... hell, they're just a mindless crowd, and I despise crowds.</p>
<p>Affirmation: You don't have to feel bad in this neon-drenched society. Society isn't the Arctic cold from which only a warm parka can save you. Society and interactions are what fire up your neural circuits. I imagined myself as a sleek machine made of high-tech, shiny aluminum and chrome - nothing else could touch me. It seems to help; I'll have to try it again.</p>
<p>Half the day, Darksynth wave blasted through my audials on rekt.network. Good, good. I've heard almost all of it. My brain craves it.
When I went to get a hit of caffeine from the machine, I saw my trainer. He walked towards me but didn't notice me. Remembering his lightning-fast and polished moves, I gave him a respectful nod and promised to jack in tomorrow.</p>
<p>I like rgb-flame from my mouse in dark kitchen.</p>

</div><p>Morning ladies and gentlemen. I was build blog on static pages until 5 am, my fingers hovering over the keyboard, and the documentation lines helpfully indicated what to do, almost instantly. Everything worked out and I went into the capsule.</p>
<p>For breakfast, I have planned a nutritious cocktail of cottage cheese, nuts and other nutritious things, the composition for which was selected for me by the AI. And while I was going to the store for natural milk, vague fragments of a dream about a technological singularity were still spinning in my head. I wanted to note this in my cloud notepad for the next blog entry and... I discovered that the notes on the smartphone are not synchronized. After digging through the logs, I checked several hypotheses, searched the bug tracker, didn’t find a solution, and swiped the data to download it from the cloud again. Sometimes it's easier to turn it off and on, really.</p>
<p>In the background was the thought of a crazy dictator dropping a smart bomb on a construction hypermarket. Connecting to media gives us a feeling of belonging to the world and to reality, but to hell with this reality, I turn on the music. However, I am sure the thought remained in the subconscious and I do not avoid it, it makes me modern.</p>

<p>Hey yo, I say to cyberspace and to myself. I decided to get out of my hole and walk the streets.   The goal is to find a place under the shimmering sky where you can connect to the matrix and immerse yourself in the code. As the old hacker taught me - be prepared for anything, especially the worst.</p>
<p>After packing my electronic arsenal into my bag, I downloaded a holographic map of the city onto my smartphone. The ghost bus, invisible to the system, was perfect for my quest. I jumped inside, plunging into the unknown.</p>
<p>Retro headphones connected by wires to the head are my homage to the old school and a way to save energy in this cutthroat cyberpunk world.</p>
<p>As soon as I had time to take a sip of my favorite sugar-free flat white, my smartphone vibrated, transmitting a message from the virtual world. A friend asks to connect a neural network to design a festival site in augmented reality. He promised to help, but the carefree mood evaporated like smoke from a cigarette. Phantom creds loomed on the horizon again.</p>
<p>Twice I walked past the open terraces of summer cafes, where for a cup of coffee you can buy a ticket to the eternity of cyberspace. Mission Complete. I moved to the air taxi call point, looking into an inconspicuous basement theater along the way. The poster promised a performance based on the biography of the legendary Arab anarchist philosopher Abu al-Ala al-Ma'arri. Alas, in an unfamiliar dialect, but I made it clear to the artistic director that I was following events and was ready to immerse myself in art.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day, rekt.network brought out live Vosto, perfectly fitting into the mosaic of my cyberpunk existence.</p>
